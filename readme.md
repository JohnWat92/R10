Project R10

In this project I used react native, react redux, react-native debugger, realm and the ex navigation package to build this app.
This app is compatible with ios and android devices.

How to run:
1. npm install
2. start the packager
3. type in the console, react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone SE"
